            <div class="grid-item"><p>In simpler terms, one who has expertise of any other discpline in addition to design and is successfully able to apply the acquired skills with ease in solving new and complex design problems is a multidisciplinary designer.

                I stress on these three words â€” expertise, apply and solving as all three are equally essential. Transitioning from the discipline of architecture to design, with all the architectural knowledge and new design problems to solve I found myself struggling with the applicability of the prior skills. For many, it can be a easy process but still many like me can have a hard time.
